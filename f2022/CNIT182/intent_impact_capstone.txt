Amishi intended to introduce herself and form a friendship with Melissa. Melissa was also wanting to relate to Amishi by talking about the labs and her labs in high school.
The impact of Melissa's words comes off as insensitive, as she assumes Amishi did not get a chance to do labs, even though they are from the same area. She is also surprised
that Amishi is able to speak English well and without an accent just because she is Indian American.
Amishi could use the opportunity to educate Melissa on the fact that just because she is Indian, it does not mean she isn't fluent in English. Melissa could use the
opportunity to reflect on how she was possibly being racially insensitive. In the future she could be more mindful of people who look different than her, and not assume
they are different than her just because of their looks.

The emoji I have chosen is ðŸ˜­.

In my home culture and demographic, most people interpret this as a laughing face, and sobbing as a form of laughing. This is mostly in people from around my age group and demographic, up to people around 30 years old for the most part.Â 

In other cultures, such as outside my age demographic or in other countries, people may interpret this emoji in a literal sense, which would be a crying emoji.

An interaction using this emoji could be someone using it to show that they think something is funny, but someone from another culture could think they are conveying that they are sad or upset.

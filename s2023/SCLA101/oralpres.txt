continues discussion of justice
  focusing on just soul, just city
  socrates, glaucon asking whether justice is desirable for own sake or only for benefits
  is justice beneficial for the individual or for society as a whole
  relationship between individual virtue and societal harmony

socrates: justice is a virtue that is necessary for well-being of both individual & society as a whole
  just soul: well-ordered community
    every part of soul (reason, spirit, desire) in balance & performs its proper function
    responsible for making wise & virtuous decisions
    soul that is out of balance (1 element dominating others) is an unjust soul
    ex. 
      soul dominated by desire prone to selfishness & lack of control
      soul dominated by spirit prone to recklessness & aggression
    analogy for just city
  just city: society where each individual plays their proper role
    one that is in a state of harmony & balance
    rulers rule with wisdom & virtue
    auxiliary class protects city
    producer class provides for needs of city
    when classes are in balance and performing proper function,
      city is just
      individuals able to live virtuous & fulfilling lives

socrates: describe 4 types of regimes/forms of government
  timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, tyranny
  each regime can be identified by ruling element & can degenerate into one another
    timocracy:
      characterized by strong military
      degenerate into oligarchy if ruling class becomes focused on wealth & power
    oligarchy:
      emphasis on private property
      degenerate into democracy if ruling class becomes focused on own interests & people become discontent
    democracy:
      ruled by the people where ruling class composed of all citizens
      emphasis on freedom & equality
      degenerate into tyranny of people become focused on own desires & rulers become corrupt
      tyranny:
        ruled by single individual with absolute power
        emphasis on ruler's own desires & lack of concern for people's well-being

  each can be identified by ruling element in the souls of citizens
  each can degenerate into the next, and eventually a society can become a tyranny if poorly governed

plato: introduces idea of philosopher-kings
  rulers of society should be philosopher-kings because:
    possess knowledge of the Good
    able to rule with wisdom & virtue
    have knowledge & wisdom to understand nature of "good life"
    argues they have ability to lead a society towards the "good life"
      life of virtue & happiness
    "Until philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophize, that is, until political power and philosophy entirely coincide"
    arguing that the current leaders, who are not genuinely philosophers, are inadequate and that true justice can only be achieved when the rulers have the knowledge and wisdom to understand the nature of justice and the good
  idea presented as a solution to problem of how to create a just society where rulers are able to make wise and virtuous decisions for good of all citizens

justice is not just an advantage for the stronger, but a virtue that is necessary for the well-being of both individual & society as a whole
philosopher-kings as a solution to the problem of creating a just society & avoiding degeneration into tyranny.
a just city in a state of harmony & balance, each individual plays proper role & rulers rule with wisdom & virtue
a just city is seen as an analogy for -
  just society requires not only virtue of justice but also wise and virtuous leaders to guide it
